# Portfolio
## My personal portfolio/cv website, made for a assigment in school.

###### Particles javascript library 
For the background on the front page, the [Particles Javascript Library](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) are used (particles.js and app.js).

###### ScrollMagic javascript library 
To make elements appear when scrolling down the page, the [ScrollMagic Javascript Library](https://scrollmagic.io/) are used.

##### To be fixed
The contact form on the bottom of the page does not work, since I have no where to send the the information.
